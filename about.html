## About

I am currently enrolled full-time in New York University's College of Arts and Science pursuing a joint major in computer science and mathematics as well as a minor in web programming and applications. I have a great interest in developing software for the Web, and I look forward to learning more about programming and development.

As an undergraduate senior, I am looking for career opportunities, so feel free to <a href="#Contact">contact me</a>.

A copy of my resume is also available <a href="#">here</a>.
